        New
        Guinea. Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569
        square kilometres (735,358 square miles). With over 279 million people, Indonesia is the world's
        fourth-most-populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous
        island,

    <h2 align="center"> Flora of Indonesia </h2>
    <p> Indonesia's terrestrial flora can be divided into several vegetation groups. The most important factor is
        rainfall,
        followed by temperature, both of which affect the availability of water. The distribution of Indonesian flora is
        dominated by broadleaf evergreen forests. This is mostly seen in the regions where population density is still
        relatively low, such as Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi and West Papua. </p> <br>
    <h3 align="left"> Sundaland </h3>
    <p> Sundaland, which is located on the west part of the Indonesian archipelago, holds about 25,000 different species
        of
        plants. 15,000 of them are endemic to this region and cannot be found anywhere else. Scyphostegiaceae is a plant
        family represented by a single species, Scyphostegia borneensis, which is endemic to Borneo. Another 155 species

        Sumatra
        include more than 100 species of Dipterocarpus, nearly a dozen of them are endemic to this island. The island of
        Java has about 270 endemic orchid species. It is home to Mentimun Jaws (Alsomitra macrocarpa) which has gliding
